# Solving-PDE-and-Laplace-Equation-in-Matlab

This computer assignment is a part of a Computer Engineering course, where the primary objective is to solve a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) utilizing a function called "pdefun." Following the PDE solution, the results are then compared to the theoretical mathematical solution. The second part of the assignment involves the numerical solution of the Laplace equation. You can find more detailed instructions and information in the CA2.pdf document.
